=====

An IRC bot for announcing what people are playing via Last.fm, Libre.fm, or any
other GNUfm server.

Status
------
Right now it doesn't do much of anything except respond to a "|beep". Actual
functionality coming Soon(tm).

A note about versions
---------------------
This project uses a few Java 7 features. You should be able to import it and
have the right settings (I hope), but make sure you have some kind of JDK 7.
Tested on Linux against OpenJDK, Oracle's should work fine too.
